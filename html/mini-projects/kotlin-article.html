          <h2>What is Kotlin?</h2>
          <p>
            Kotlin is a statically typed programming language developed by
            JetBrains (the same company behind IntelliJ IDEA). It runs on the
            Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can also compile to JavaScript and
            native binaries for building cross-platform applications.
