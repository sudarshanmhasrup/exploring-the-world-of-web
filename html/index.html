          <h1>The role of HTML</h1>
          <p>
            We often overlook how simple HTML is to learn and how crucial it is
            for laying out content on the web. While you're not entirely wrong,
            you might be underestimating the importance of HTML. It's the
            backbone of every web documentâ€”not just for making pages look
            attractive, but also for ensuring accessibility. Below is a list of
            my HTML mini-projects that focus on website structure and
            understanding the true potential of HTML.
