### About this repository

I love talking about the webâ€”it's incredible how it has made software solutions more accessible than ever. When working with Android or iOS, you're usually limited to a single platform, except when using cross-platform solutions. But with the web, your software becomes instantly accessible to a much wider audience. Although web development isn't my primary area of expertise, I'm actively learning and gaining hands-on experience. This repository contains all the web projects and source code I've created throughout my web development journey.
