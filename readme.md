### About this repository

I love talking about the webâ€”it's incredible how it has made software solutions more accessible than ever. When working with Android or iOS, you're usually limited to a single platform, except when using cross-platform solutions. But with the web, your software becomes instantly accessible to a much wider audience. Although web development isn't my primary area of expertise, I'm actively learning and gaining hands-on experience. This repository contains all the web projects and source code I've created throughout my web development journey.

### Project structure

This project is organized by technology, with separate folders for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each folder contains projects or examples related to that specific technology. Any additional folders either represent standalone projects or modules that are part of existing ones.

1. `html`/ - This folder contains all the HTML files I created while learning HTML. It includes a single `index.html` file that serves as a centralized entry point, linking to all other files within the folder.
